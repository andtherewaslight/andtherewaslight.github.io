I am Claudio Oton, I am a researcher at [Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it) in Pisa, Italy, where I work doing research on fiber-optics. Please let me know if there is any issue in the software, a mistake in the text, or any other suggestion you may have. You may contact me at c.oton{at}santannapisa.it


## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Marco Vannucci for introducing me to Jupyter Notebooks, which were used for making the software, and to [Ezequiel Casta√±o](https://elc.github.io/), who showed me how to make interactive online programs from Jupyter notebooks.
